This is the resolution of Machine Learning Assestment for Sequencr. For this task I develop a Classification System using either Logistic Regression and Bert models. The dataset I choose was BBC News Summary(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pariza/bbc-news-summary/data) To use the API as its running in localhost one must run APIClassification.py in one terminal (to start the service) and then they can run TestAPI.py script. in TestAPI.py one must edit the file introducing what text they want to predict and choose which model, then simply run by terminal "Python TestAPI.py" and the output will the prediction. In order for this to work, regarding file size issues, one must download a file called "model.safetensors" from this link:

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-4ba5eqYFBvnbRHvwYMfmDQEp5kUzb1D/view?usp=drive_link

Afterwards it must be save inside the folder "BBC News Summary". If there is any Python library left to install, please use the file requirements.txt by typing in terminal "Python -m  pip install -r requirements. txt".
